1. find the square of a given number:
 --> enter a number 
 --> multiply by the same number
 var x = 25;
 x *= x;
 

2. look at the time of the day and tell whether it's time for breakfast, 
lunch of dinner:
var time=12
if {time = 12 == " breakfast"}
else {"lunch"};
 -->please enter time (in 24hr format)
 -->is time less than 12?
 --> if true then breakfast
 --> if time greater than 12 but less than 19 then lunch
 --> if time greater 19 then dinner

3. given a number, find whether the number is odd or even:
 var number = 5
 var even = 2,4,,6,8,10;
 var odd = 1,3,5,7,9;
 if {number == even }
 else {number == odd};
 --> enter a number between 1 - 10
 --> if user number is 1 or 3 or 5 or 7 or 9 then odd
 --> if user number 2 or 4 or 6 or 8 or 10 then even

4. find out whether a given number or a string is palindrome:
 --> enter a string 
 --> is user string is exact same in reverse 
 --> if yes then it is palindrom
 --> if not enter again

5. find the 10th number of fibonacci series:
 --> please enter number
 --> add same number 
 --> add result to next digit up
 --> repeat steps until 10th sequence
